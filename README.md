## Description <a id="description"></a> :page_facing_up:

This project uses node.js and the inquirer npm package to prompt a user with questions and collect their answers. The answers are then used to generate a readme.md file. The readme contains section headers, bullets, hyperlinks, and icons to build a professional readme.

An example readme generated through this application is contained in the 'autoREADME.md' file. When the application is run, it will overwrite the file.

Here is a [demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n2ufITo8I2avMhoGugxXL2UQBWANRtZS/view)
